# Bamazon

This application mimics a Amazon-like store front using MySQL and node.  It can be used both by customers and managers.  Customers can run a command in order to view available products and their associated information.

Managers can run a command where they are given the option to view available products, view low inventory products, add to existing inventory, or add a new product.  

The existing database will update stock and product quantities as various commands are run.
