# Bamazon

This application mimics a Amazon-like store front using MySQL and node.  It can be used both by customers and managers.  Customers can run a command in order to view available products and their associated information.
For visuals, take a look at the images in my images folder: 
    "images/first-command-customer.png" and
    "images/second-command-customer.png"

Managers can run a command where they are given the option to view available products, view low inventory products, add to existing inventory, or add a new product.
For visuals, take a look at the images in my images folder: 
"images/view-products-manager.png",
"images/low-inventory.png",
"images/add-inventory.png"
"images/new-product.png" 

The existing database will update stock and product quantities as various commands are run.
